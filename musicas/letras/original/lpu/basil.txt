<h2>Basil (2008 DEMO)</h2>
<pre>And I'm taking my time, I'm shaping and shaking the rhyme like I'm staking my claim
Like I'm making a bomb, I'm making it simple and plain
That I'm sick of the game, sick of the simple and same
I got that reality rap back to the basics, give me that beat
It is what it's got to be
Cause the rhythm's an addiction that I got to feed
You could say what you think that it ought to be
And pop lip to your buddies, just not with me, OK?
Cause I'm heavy with the track drums
Cat with the boom bap back in action
Slap all your crew back to a fraction
Rap like a Wu pack on my back, son
And they do it 'cause the rep stay solid and true
Reality, probably stop it 'fore we do
Something stupid and ridiculous, looking so sick of this
Stupid moving music to the life and death until your breath is gone</pre>
