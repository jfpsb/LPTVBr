<h2>Nobody Can Save Me</h2>
<pre>I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head

Head-first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake

Now you tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
I’m chasing up the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Stare into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong

Head-first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way

Now you tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
I’m chasing up the darkness inside
Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here
I’ve been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here

I wanna fall wide awake
Now so tell me It’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
And only I can save me now
I’m holding on a light
Chasing up the darkness inside
And I don’t wanna let you down
But only I can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here</pre>
