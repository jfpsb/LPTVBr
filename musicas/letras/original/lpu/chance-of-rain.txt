<h2>Chance Of Rain (2006 DEMO)</h2>
<pre>She had never really understood
She demanded her respect
Twenty years of falling under foot
Twenty reasons to regret

You would looked for what you couldn't see
Scared to be what she became
She would tell you what you couldn't be
And why you had yourself to blame

Alone again
You try to disappear and
Hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down

You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

She was ready with your penalty
When eventually you'd fall
She was there inside your memory
Saying this was all your fault

Alone again
You try to disappear and
Hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down

You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

Uuuh uuuh uuuh 
Uuuh uuuh uuuh 

Alone again
It's all becoming clear
You hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down

You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound
This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound</pre>
